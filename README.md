# Stanford NLP 2019

I created this repo to collect resources I used for hosting the [TWIML](https://twimlai.com/) study group sessions on language modeling, RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs. The sessions were based on the Stanford class [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/) from Winter 2019.

This repo includes:
- List of [recommended material](https://github.com/stefan-jo/stanford_nlp/blob/master/resources.md) for further reading, viewing or listening...
- My code from porting Andrej Karpathy's mini character RNN from numpy to Pytorch
